The present book is essentially a book on the finite element method,
although we discuss many other choices of basis functions and other
applications than partial differential equations. The
literature on finite elements contains books of many different
flavors, ranging from the abstract view of the method
cite{JohnsonFEM87,Quarteroni_Valli,Brenner_Scott,Braess} to a more 
practical, algorithmic treatment of the subject cite{zienkiewicz1977finite}. The present book has
a very strong algorithmic focus (``how to compute''), but formulate
the method in the abstract form with variational forms and function
spaces.


One highly valued feature of the finite element method is the prospect
of rigorous analysis provided by the functional analysis framework. In
particular, for elliptic problems (or in general symmetric problems)
the theory provides error control via sharp estimates and efficient
computations via multiscale algorithms. In fact, the development of
this mathematical theory of finite element methods is one of the
highlights of numerical analysis. However, within scientific computing
the computational engine of the finite element method is being used
far outside what is theoretically understood. Obviously, this is a
trend that will continue in the future. Hence, it is our aim here
provide the reader with the gory details of the implementation in an
explicit, user-friendly and simplistic manner to lower the threshold
of usage and to provide tools for verification and debugging that are
applicable in general situations.

An important motivation for writing this book was to provide an
intuitive approach to the finite element method, using the
mathematical language frameworks such as the FEniCS software
cite{fenics_book}. FEniCS is a modern, very powerful tool for solving
partial differential equations by the finite element method, and it
was designed to make implementations very compact for those who are
used to the abstract formulation of the method.  Our aim here is
different.

A standard reference for FEniCS users have been the excellent text by
Brenner and Scott cite{Brenner_Scott}, but for many students with weak
formal mathematical background, the learning curve became
unnecessarily steep using this book to take advantage of FEniCS.  The
present book grew out of the need to explain variational formulations
in the most intuitive way so FEniCS users can transform their PDE
problem into the proper formulation for FEniCS programming. We then
added material such that also the details of the most fundamental
finite element algorithms could easily be understood.

The learning outcomes of this book are four-fold

 o understanding various types of variational formulations of PDE problems,
 o understanding the machinery of finite element algorithms,
   with an emphasis on one-dimensional problems,
 o understanding potential artifacts in simulation results,
 o understanding how variational formulations can be used in other
   contexts (polynomial chaos expansions, solving linear systems).

The exposition is recognized by very explicit mathematics, i.e., we
have tried to write out all details of the finite element ``engine''
such that a reader can calculate a finite element problem by
hand. Explaining all details and carrying them out by hand are
formidable tasks in two- and three-dimensional PDE problems, so we
restrict the attention to one space dimension when it comes to
detailed calculations.  Although we imagine that the reader will use
FEniCS or other similar software to actually solve finite element
problems, we strongly believe that successful application of such
complex software requires a thorough understanding of the underlying
method, which is best gained by hand calculations of the steps in the
algorithms. Also, hand calculations are indispensable for debugging
finite element programs: one can run a one-dimensional problem, print
out intermediate results, and compare with separate hand calculations.
When the program is fully verified in 1D, ideally the program should
turned into a 2D/3D simulation simply by switching from a 1D mesh
to the relevant 2D/3D mesh.


When working with algorithms and hand calculations in the present
book, we emphasize the usefulness of symbolic computing. Our choice is
the free SymPy package, which is very easy to use for students and
which gives a seamless transition from symbolic to numerical
computing.  Most of the numerical algorithms in this book are
summarized as compact SymPy programs. However, symbolic computing
certainly has its limitations, especially when it comes to speed, so
their numerical counterparts are usually also developed in the
text. The reader should be able to write her own finite element
program for one-dimensional problems, but otherwise we have no aim to
educate the reader to write fast, state-of-the-art finite element
programs!

Another learning outcome (although not needed to be a successful
FEniCS user) is to understand how the finite element method is a
special case of more general variational approaches to solving
equations. Therefore, we also treat uncertainty quantification via
polynomial chaos methods and conjugate gradient-like methods for
solving linear systems in a way that hopefully gives the reader an
understanding of how seemingly very different numerical methods
actually are just variants of a common way of reasoning.

Many common topics found in finite element books are not present in
this book. A striking feature is perhaps the presence of the abstract
formulation of the finite element method, but without any classical
error analysis.  The reason is that we have taken a very practical
approach to the contents: what does a user need to know to safely
apply finite element software?  A thorough understanding of the errors
is obviously essential, but the classical error analysis of elliptic
problems is of limited practical interest for the practitioner, except
for the final results regarding convergence rates of different types
of finite elements.

In time-dependent problems, on the other hand, a lot of things can go
wrong with finite element solutions, but the extensions of the
classical finite element error analysis to time dependency quickly
meets limitations with respect to explaining typical numerical
artifacts. We therefore follow a completely different type of
analysis, namely the one often used for finite difference methods:
insight through numerical dispersion relations and similar results
based on exact discrete solutions via Fourier wave
components. Actually, all the analysis of the quality of finite
element solutions are in this book done with the aid of techniques for
analyzing finite difference methods, so a knowledge of finite
differences is needed. This approach also makes it very easy to
compare the two methods, which is frequently done throughout the text.

The mathematical notation in this text makes deviations from the
literature trends. Especially books on the abstract formulation of the
finite element method often denotes the numerical solution by $u_h$.
Our mathematical notation is dictated by the natural notation in a
computer code, so if `u` is the unknown in the code, we let $u$ be the
corresponding quantity in the mathematical description as well. When
also the exact solution of the PDE problem is needed, it is usually
denoted by $\uex$. Especially in the chapter on nonlinear problems we
introduce notations that are handy in a program and use the same
notation in the mathematics such that we achieve as close
correspondence as possible between the mathematics and the code.

=== Contents ===

The very first chapter starts with a quick overview of how PDE
problems are solved by the finite element method. The next four
chapters go into deep detail of the algorithms. We employ a successful
idea, pursued by Larson and Bengzon cite{Larson_2013} in particular,
of first treating finite element approximation *before* attacking PDE
problems. Chapter ref{ch:approx:global} explains approximation of
functions in function spaces from a general point of view, where finite
element basis functions constitute one example to be explored in
Chapter ref{ch:approx:fe}.  The principles of variational
formulations constitute the subject of Chapter ref{ch:varform:global}.
A lot of details of the finite element machinery are met already in
the approximation problem in Chapter ref{ch:approx:fe}, so when these
topics are familiar together with the variational formulations of
Chapter ref{ch:varform:global}, it is easier to put the entire finite
element method together in Chapter
ref{ch:varform:fe} with variational formulations
of PDE problems, boundary conditions, and the necessary
finite element computing algorithms.  Our experience is that
this pedagogical approach greatly simplifies the learning process for
students.  Chapter ref{ch:femtime} explains how time-dependent
problems are attacked, primarily by using finite difference
discretizations in time. Here we develop the corresponding finite
difference schemes and analyze them via Fourier components and
numerical dispersion relations. How to set up variational formulations
of systems of PDEs, and in particular the way systems are treated in
FEniCS, is the topic of Chapter ref{ch:femsys}.
Nonlinear ODE and PDE problems are treated quite comprehensively in
Chapter ref{ch:nonlin}.
Finally, the applicability
of variational thinking appears in a different context in  Chapter ref{ch:cg} where we construct
iterative methods for linear systems and derive methods in the Conjugate
gradient family.

#This chapter becomes a nice illustration of the power of the theory in
#the beginning of the book.
