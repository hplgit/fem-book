The finite element method is a versatile approach to construct
computational schemes to solve any partial differential equation on
any domain in any dimension. The method may at first glance appear
cumbersome and even unnatural as it relies on variational formulations
and polynomial spaces. However, the study of these somewhat abstract
concepts pays off as the finite element method provides a general
recipe for efficient and accurate simulations.

Let us start by outlining the concepts briefly.
Consider the following PDE in 2D:

!bt
\[
-\nabla^2 u = -u_{xx} - u_{yy} = f,
\]
!et
equipped with suitable boundary conditions.
A finite difference scheme to solve the current PDE
would in the simplest case be described by the stencil

!bt
\begin{equation}
label{overview:2d:fdm0}
-\frac{u_{i-1,j} - 2 u_{i,j} + u_{i+1,j}}{h^2}
-\frac{u_{i,j-1} - 2 u_{i,j} + u_{i,j+1}}{h^2}
 = f_{i}
\end{equation}
!et
or reordered to the more recognizable 

!bt
\begin{equation}
label{overview:2d:fdm}
\frac{-u_{i-1,j} -u_{i,j-1} + 4 u_{i,j} - u_{i+1,j} -u_{i,j+1}}{h^2}  = f_{i}
\tp
\end{equation}
!et

On a structured mesh, the stencil appears natural and
is convenient to implement.
However, for a unstructured, ``complicated'' domain
as shown in Figure ref{overview:meshex},
we would need to be careful when placing
points and evaluating stencils and functions.  Both accuracy and efficiency
may easily be sacrificed by a reckless implementation.

In general, a domain like the one represented in Figure
ref{overview:meshex} will be represented by a triangulation. The
finite element method (and the finite volume method which often is a
special case of the finite element method) is a methodology for
creating stencils like (ref{overview:2d:fdm}) in a structured manner
that adapt to the underlying triangulation.

The triangulation in Figure ref{overview:meshex} is a mesh that
consists of cells that are connected and defined in terms of
vertices. The fundamental idea of the finite element method is
to construct a procedure to compute a stencil on a general element and
then apply this procedure to each element of the mesh. Let
us therefore denote the mesh as $\Omega$ while $\Omega_e$ is the domain
of a generic element such that $\Omega=\cup_e \Omega_e$.

This is exactly the point where the challenges of the finite element
method start and where we need some new concepts.  The basic question
is: How should we create a stencil like (ref{overview:2d:fdm}) for a
general element and a general PDE that has the maximal accuracy and
minimal computational complexity at the current triangulation?  The
two basic building blocks of the finite element method are

 o the solution is represented in terms of a polynomial expression on the
   given general element, and
 o a variational formulation of the PDE
   where element-wise integration enables the PDE to be transformed to a
   stencil.

Step 1 is, as will be explained later, conveniently represented
both implementation-wise and mathematically as a solution

!bt
\begin{equation}
label{overview:u:fem}
u = \sum_{i=0}^N c_i \baspsi_i(x,y),
\end{equation}
!et
where $\{c_i\}$ are the coefficients to be determined
(often called the degrees of freedom)
and $\baspsi_i(x,y)$ are prescribed polynomials.
The basis functions $\baspsi_i(x,y)$ used to express the solution
is often called the trial functions.  
The next step is the variational formulation. This step
may seem like a magic trick or a cumbersome
mathematical exercise at first glance.
We take the PDE and multiply by a function $v$ (usually called 
the test function)
and integrate over an element $\Omega_e$ and obtain the expression

!bt
\begin{equation}
label{overview:poisson}
\int_{\Omega_e} -\nabla^2 u \, v \dx =  \int_{\Omega_e} f \, v \dx
\end{equation}
!et

A perfectly natural question at this point is: Why multiply
with a test function $v$? The simple answer is that
there are $N+1$ unknowns that need to be determined in $u$
in (ref{overview:u:fem})
and for this we need $N+1$ equations. The equations are
obtained by using  $N+1$ different test functions which when used
in  (ref{overview:fem:a})
give rise to $N+1$ linearly independent equations.

idx{test function}

While (ref{overview:poisson}) is a variational formulation of
our PDE problem, it is not the most common form.
It is common to re-write
!bt
\begin{equation}
label{overview:fem:a}
\int_{\Omega_e} -\nabla^2 u \, v \dx
\end{equation}
!et
to weaken the requirement of the polynomial space used for the
trial functions (that here needs to be twice differentiable)
and write this term in its corresponding weak form.
That
is, the term is rewritten in terms of first-derivatives only (of
both the trial and the test function)  with the aid of Gauss-Green's lemma:

!bt
\begin{equation}
label{overview:fem:a:weak}
\int_{\Omega_e} -\nabla^2 u \, v \dx  =
\int_{\Omega_e} \nabla u \cdot \nabla v \dx   - \int_{\partial \Omega_e} \frac{\partial u}{\partial n} \,  v \,  dS
\end{equation}
!et
The reasons behind this alternative formulation are rather mathematical and will
not be a major subject of this book as they are well described elsewhere.
In fact, a precise explanation would need tools from functional analysis.

With the above rewrite and assuming now that the boundary term vanishes due to
boundary conditions (why this is possible will be dealt with in detail
later in this book) the
stencil, corresponding to (ref{overview:2d:fdm}),  is represented by

!bt
\[
\int_{\Omega_e} \nabla u \cdot \nabla v \dx
\]
!et
where $u$ is called the *trial function*, $v$ is called a *test function*,
and $\Omega$ is an element of
a triangulated mesh. The idea of software like FEniCS is that this
piece of mathematics can be directly expressed in terms of Python code as

!bc pycod
mesh = Mesh("some_file")
V = FunctionSpace(mesh, "some polynomial")
u = TrialFunction(V)
v = TestFunction(V)
a = dot(grad(u), grad(v))*dx
!ec

The methodology and code in this example is not tied to a particular
equation, except the formula for `a`, holding the derivatives of our
sample PDE, but any other PDE terms could be expressed via `u`, `v`,
`grad`, and other symbolic operators in this line of code.  In fact,
finite element packages like FEniCS are typically structured as
general toolboxes that can be adapted to any PDE as soon as the
derivation of variational formulations is mastered.  The main obstacle
here for a novice FEM user is then to understand the concept of trial
functions and test functions realized in terms of polynomial spaces.


Hence, a finite element formulation (or a weak formulation) of
the Poisson problem that works on any mesh $\Omega$ can be written
in terms of solving the problem:
!bt
\[ \int_\Omega\nabla u\cdot\nabla vd\dx = \int_\Omega fv\dx\tp\]
!et
By varying the trial and test spaces we obtain different stencils,
some of which will be identical to finite difference schemes on
particular meshes. We will now show a complete FEniCS program to
illustrate how a typical finite element code may be structured

!bc pycod
mesh = Mesh("some_file")
V = FunctionSpace(mesh, "some polynomial")
u = TrialFunction(V)
v = TestFunction(V)
a = dot(grad(u), grad(v))*dx
L = f*v*dx

bc = DirichletBC(V, "some_function", "some_domain")
solution = Function(V)  # unknown FEM function
solve(a == L, solution, bc)
plot(solution)
!ec
##where `bc` holds information about boundary conditions. This information
##is connected to information about the triangulation, the *mesh*.
##Assuming $u=0$ on the boundary, we can in FEniCS generate a triangular
##mesh over a rectangular domain $[-1,-1]\times [-1,1]$ as follows:
##

##mesh = Rectangle(

While the finite element method is versatile and may be adapted to any
PDE on any domain in any dimension, the different methods that are
derived by using different trial and test functions may vary
significantly in terms of accuracy and efficiency. In fact, a bad choice of polynomial space may in some cases lead to a
completely wrong result. This is particularly the case for complicated
PDEs. For this reason, it is dangerous to regard the method as a black
box and not do proper verification of the method for a  particular
application.



In this book we will put focus on verification in the sense
that we provide the reader with explicit calculations as
well as demonstrations of how such computations can be performed
by using symbolic or numerical calculations to control the
various parts of the computational framework. In our view, there
are three important tests that should be frequently employed
during verification:

 o reducing the model problem to 1D and carefully check the calculations involved in the variational formulation on a small 1D mesh
 o perform the calculation involved on one general or random element
 o test whether convergences is obtained and to what order the method converge by refining the mesh

The two first tasks here should ideally be performed by independent calculations
outside the framework used for the simulations. In our view `sympy` is a
convenient tool that can be used to assist hand calculations.

So far, we have outlined how the finite element method handles derivatives
in a PDE, but we also had a right-hand side function $f$. This term is multiplied
by the test function $v$ as well, such that the entire Poisson equation
is transformed to

!bt
\[ \int_\Omega\nabla u\cdot\nabla vd\dx = \int_\Omega fv\dx\tp\]
!et
This statement is assumed valid for all test functions $v$ in some
function space $V$ of polynomials. The right-hand side expression is
coded in FEniCS as

!bc pycod
L = f*v*dx
!ec
and the problem is then solved by the statements

!bc pycod
u = Function(V)  # unknown FEM function
solve(a == L, u, bc)
!ec
where `bc` holds information about boundary conditions. This information
is connected to information about the triangulation, the *mesh*.
Assuming $u=0$ on the boundary, we can in FEniCS generate a triangular
mesh over a rectangular domain $[-1,-1]\times [-1,1]$ as follows:

!bc pycod
mesh = RectangleMesh(Point(-1, -1), Point(1, 1), 10, 10)
bc = DirichletBC(V, 0, 'on_boundary')
!ec

Mathematically, the finite element method transforms our PDE to
a sparse linear system. The `solve` step performs two tasks:
construction of the linear system based on the given information about
the domain and its elements, and then solution of the linear system by
either an iterative or direct method.

We are now in a position to summarize all the parts of a FEniCS program
that solves the Poisson equation by the finite element method:

!bc pycod
from fenics import *
mesh = RectangleMesh(Point(-1, -1), Point(1, 1), 10, 10)
V = FunctionSpace(mesh, 'P', 2)  # quadratic polynomials
bc = DirichletBC(V, 0, 'on_boundary')
u = TrialFunction(V)
v = TestFunction(V)
a = dot(grad(u), grad(v))*dx
L = f*v*dx
u = Function(V)  # unknown FEM function to be computed
solve(a == L, u, bc)
vtkfile = File('poisson.pvd'); vtkfile << u  # store solution
!ec
Solving a different PDE is a matter of changing `a` and `L`. We refer to
the FEniCS tutorial cite{ftut1,ftut2} for lots of examples.

Although we assert here that the finite element method is a tool that
can solve any PDE problem on any domain of any complexity, the
fundamental ideas of the method are in fact even more general. 
We will therefore start the book by variational 
methods for approximation in general, then consider the finite
element in a wide range of applications, and finally we end up with 
a short description of how the solution of linear systems
also fit into this framework. 

#This
#book will emphasize this general framework and show how the finite
#element method is actually just one way to choose the expansion
#functions $\baspsi$, but there are many others, giving rise to other
#frameworks for other problems, such as uncertainty quantification via
#polynomial chaos theory in Chapter ref{ch:pc}. By understanding the
#general framework of approximations of the form (ref{overview:u:fem}),
#i.e, understanding how $\baspsi_i$ are constructed and how $c_i$ are
#computed, we believe the reader can develop a better intuitive
#understanding the finite element method in particular and its
#foundation in general.
